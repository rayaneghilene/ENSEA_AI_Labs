This repository contains the materials and code for the AI & Big Data Lab Session, a series of hands-on workshops designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and big data. The sessions cover topics such as machine learning, deep learning, data preprocessing, data visualization, and big data processing using Apache Spark.

The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a lab session. Within each folder, you'll find the relevant materials for that session, including Jupyter notebooks, data files, and other resources. Each lab session includes a set of exercises that are designed to help you apply the concepts covered in the session and build your skills in AI and big data.

This repository is designed for anyone who wants to learn about AI and big data, regardless of their level of experience. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, you'll find something of value in these lab sessions. The code and materials in this repository are open source, so feel free to use them for your own learning or teaching purposes.

We hope that you find these lab sessions useful and informative. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request in this repository. Let's learn and build together!
