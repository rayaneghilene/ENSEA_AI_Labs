# ENSEA AI Labs
This repository contains the code for the following AI labs completed at ENSEA:

- [TP1: Introduction to AI](TP1_Introduction_to_AI/)
- [TP2: Sentiment Analysis](TP2_Sentiment_Analysis/)
- [TP3: Language Models](TP3_Language_Models/)
- [TP4: Recommending a Spotify Playlist](TP4_Recommending_Spotify_Playlist/)
- [TP5: Graph Neural Network for Recommendation](TP5_Graph_Neural_Network_for_Recommendation/)

## TP1: Introduction to AI

In this lab, you will be introduced to the world of Deep Learning with the exploration of two techniques:

- Training an inverting Neuron
- Neural Style Transfer.

## TP2: Sentiment Analysis

In this lab, you will be performing Sentiment Analysis using two types of Neural Nets:

- Feed Forward Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks

## TP3: Language Models

In this lab, you will be creating a Language Model using two methods:

- N-grams
- Feed Forward Networks

## TP4: Recommending a Spotify Playlist

In this lab, you will be creating a Deep RecSys Model performing recommendation on Spotify Data.

Slides for this lab can be found in [Recommendation Part 1](TP4_Recommending_Spotify_Playlist/Recommendation_Part1.pdf).

## TP5: Graph Neural Network for Recommendation

In this lab, you will be creating a Deep Graph RecSys Model performing recommendation on MovieLens Dataset.


## Why it matters
These AI labs demonstrate my proficiency in several key areas of AI, including data preprocessing, machine learning, and deep learning. They showcase my ability to develop and implement AI algorithms to solve real-world problems, as well as my experience working with popular AI libraries and tools.


## How to use
To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the folder corresponding to the lab you're interested in. Each lab contains its own set of instructions and code files, which should be self-contained and easy to follow.

The code is written in Python and requires the installation of several Python packages, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, and OpenCV.
