# ENSEA AI Labs

This repository contains the code for a series of AI labs completed during my time at ENSEA. The labs cover a range of topics, including data preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

## What's included

Each lab is organized into a separate folder, with its own set of instructions and code files. Here's a brief overview of what's included:

- Lab 1: Data preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy
- Lab 2: Supervised learning with Scikit-learn
- Lab 3: Unsupervised learning with Scikit-learn
- Lab 4: Neural networks with Keras
- Lab 5: Convolutional neural networks with Keras
- Lab 6: Object detection with YOLOv3

## How to use

To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in each lab's folder. The code is written in Python and requires the installation of several Python packages, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, and OpenCV.

## Why it matters

These AI labs demonstrate my proficiency in several key areas of AI, including data preprocessing, machine learning, and deep learning. They showcase my ability to develop and implement AI algorithms to solve real-world problems, as well as my experience working with popular AI libraries and tools.
